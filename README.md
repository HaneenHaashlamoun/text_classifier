-[x] To accomplish your primary task youâ€™ll need install several libraries and external assets.

## Implementation Notes
-[x] You are only required to build the Baseline Model.
-[x] Your project will require several dependencies to be installed. Figure out which ones.
-[x] Your project will require downloading external assets to particular locations, and with particular names.
-[x] Some example code may cause errors. Troubleshoot the errors and see if you can fix them.
